🚀 Real-Time Object Detection Using YOLO & Webcam Feed
Harness the power of YOLO (You Only Look Once)—a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm—for blazing fast, real-time object detection using your webcam! This project uses OpenCV and a pre-trained YOLOv3 model to detect and label objects from a live video stream with high accuracy and speed.
🎯 Whether you're a beginner exploring computer vision or a developer building smart surveillance systems, this mini-project is a perfect entry point into object detection.

🌟 Key Highlights:
📸 Live Webcam Feed Integration – Watch detection happen in real-time!
🧠 YOLOv3 Model – Fast and accurate object detection.
🟩 Bounding Boxes with Labels – Easily identify what your camera sees.
💡 Clean & Simple Code – Easy to read, run, and modify.
⚙️ Modular Design – Plug in different YOLO weights or upgrade to YOLOv5/YOLOv8.
🛠️ Built With:

Python 3
OpenCV
YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once)
COCO Dataset (for object labels)
